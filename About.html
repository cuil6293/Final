				<h3>Our founding</h3>
				<p id="Para1">Want to learn more about someone? Just pop by WeCU! We are a small company that's been built from the ground up by our founder Gibus Yor Daytah when he found out that there was a severe drought of data in the market. Since 1996, our founder has been working on ways to mine data ethically and efficiently by himself. He recruited a few people he knew and eventually WeCU grew into the company it is today.</p>

				<h3>We care about you!</h3>
